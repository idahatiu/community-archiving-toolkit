# Frequently Asked Questions for Digital Archiving & Storytelling for Historically Underrepresented-Communities

## What is this initiative all about?
Our goal is to support the site-specific preservation needs of historically-underrepresented communities and their socio-cultural identity and narratives through digital archiving and digital storytelling. More than platforms and processes, we take a holistic approach to community-archiving with a focus on people.

## Who are the collaborators?
IXeM (ImaginX en Movimiento), is a grassroots digital archives collective based in Tongva territory (currently known as Los Angeles) that seeks to support archival projects being imagined and built outside of cultural heritage institutions by Black, Indigenous, women and LGBTQIA+ of color, and diasporic groups through solidarity and coalition-building.

Indiana University Bloomington Institute for Digital Arts & Humanities (IDAH) fosters digitally-inflected creative pursuits, research, and teaching for IU Bloomington faculty and students who represent a broadly inclusive constituency across the arts and humanities, whether they are experimenting for the first time with digital methods or advancing a project for public or scholarly audiences, through thoughtful critique and inclusive approaches.

## Who are the partners?
Our focus is currently on communities surrounding IXeM's and IDAH's home base -- present-day, Los Angeles, California and Bloomington, Indiana. However, we are eager to extend partnerships into the Midwest, starting with Indiana, IDAH's home state, and Illinois, IXeM's newly adopted state. If your organization is interested in learning more about this work, contact [idah@indiana.edu](mailto:idah@indiana.edu). 

##  What are the partners' responsibilities and commitments?
Partners lead outreach to their community or communities. They determine community needs for digital archiving and storytelling, and they help foster relationship-building between the collaborators and the partner communities.

## How will the collaborators provide support?
As part of organic collaborations, we are in the process of developing a toolkit that community partners can adapt for ongoing community-memory work. The toolkit will comprise: 1) strategies for community needs assessment, 2) training modules that supports workflows for digital community-archiving, and 3) an open-source platform for curating and sharing digital archives and stories. Our goal is to provide a framework so partners can continue to do this work without necessarily collaborating with IDAH or IXeM.  

## Who will have access to community stories and artifacts?
Contributors will have options. Stories and artifacts could be shared widely via the Internet either through the platform we provide, platforms already supported by communities, and/or social media. Stories and artifacts can also be captured for personal, familial archives. In all cases, the artifacts and stories will be stewarded (fully controlled) by community partners and/or individual contributors.  

## How long will this work take?
This is a slow roll! Above all else, we need to build a relationship with community partners. We need to learn about community needs. We need to understand community capacity for engaging in this kind of work before we assist in actual archive- and story-collecting. A community project can take up to a year, from start to finish, during which time collaborators and partners are learning from each other. 

## What are some example projects?
There are so many great community-driven digital archives. The two we'd like to call out here:
